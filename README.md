# ronoxdegrand.github.io

My first website to be on the internet. It is purely front end, and is entirely native. It was initially meant to serve as my CV as well but for that I'll have to alter its content. I dont feel like doing that considering that I made it a while ago (January of 2020 to be precise).

Its wierd to admit that I'm proud that its not a pain to look at.

I am however testing github out with this as well.
